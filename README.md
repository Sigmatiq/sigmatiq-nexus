# Sigmatiq Nexus

A high-performance strategy engine for real-time institutional flow analysis.

## Architecture
The Nexus acts as a middle-tier between **Ingestion** and **Execution**.

1. **Ingest (C#):** Pushes raw option trades to `md:options:trades` Redis Stream.
2. **Nexus (Python/Polars):** 
   - **Stage 1 (Heuristic):** Uses Polars to calculate Delta-Skew/Aggressor bias in microseconds.
   - **Stage 2 (AI):** Uses ONNX Runtime to validate trajectories with the RL Brain.
3. **Decisions:** Publishes `BET` or `PASS` results to `signal:final:*` Redis channels.
4. **Persistence:** Appends final/intermediate/final-block payloads to `live:persistence:events`; `Sigmatiq.Options.LivePersistenceWorker` stores them in `live.nexus_strategy_signal` for EOD review.

## Live decision contract

- Decisions are based on completed New York trading windows, not wall-clock time on the worker host.
- `10:00` evaluates `09:30-10:00`, `10:30` evaluates `10:00-10:30`, `11:00` evaluates `10:30-11:00`, `11:30` evaluates `11:00-11:30`, and `12:00` evaluates `11:30-12:00`.
- Completed windows are evaluated after `NEXUS_WINDOW_EVALUATION_GRACE_SECONDS`, so the first post-boundary trade does not immediately freeze the window.
- If a trade arrives for a window that was already evaluated, Nexus publishes `WINDOW_LATE_EVENT` as audit-only evidence with late premium totals; it does not re-evaluate or re-trade that window.
- Redis Stream offsets are persisted per input stream under `NEXUS_STREAM_OFFSET_KEY`, so worker restarts resume from the last processed ID instead of starting from new-only `$`.
- First trigger wins by default per `session_date + symbol`, so each symbol has one independent trade lane per NY session.
- Final single-leg `BET` messages acquire Redis-backed first-trigger locks before publishing, so restarts do not reopen the same symbol lane.
- `etf_confluence_sniper` also participates in a separate shared group lock across the configured ETF universe, controlled by `NEXUS_GROUP_LOCK_STRATEGIES`.
- Result: `SPY` and `QQQ` can each fire independently, while the group confluence lane still remains single-fire.
- `etf_confluence_sniper` is evaluated first for each eligible window.
- `etf_open_specialist` is the explicit 10:00 ET cheap-call rule for the completed 09:30-10:00 window.
- `etf_put_credit_open30_spread` is the paper-only 10:00 ET vertical put-credit spread read for SPY/QQQ when open30 call premium dominates and a same-expiry spread can be quoted at the minimum credit.
- `etf_call_credit_open30_spread` is the paper-only 10:00 ET vertical call-credit spread read for SPY only when open30 put premium dominates and a same-expiry spread can be quoted at the minimum credit.
- `etf_low_sweep_core` remains available as the tested low-sweep candidate; `etf_flow_specialist` and `etf_momentum_specialist` are restricted to their researched 10:30 and 11:00 entry windows.
- Every implemented strategy now publishes a per-window `WINDOW_VIEW` sentiment for every completed window from `09:30-12:00` ET, independent of whether that strategy is allowed to emit a trade candidate in that slot.
- Nexus also publishes one per-window `WINDOW_PRICING` message per symbol/window with the cheapest contract, costliest contract, and cheap/costly side summary derived from pricing-lag inside that completed window.
- Each strategy now has a fail-closed feature gate. If required live fields are missing, Nexus emits a stage `0` `BLOCKED` diagnostic on the same `nexus_window_view:{symbol}:{strategy}:{entry_label}` key family and skips the strategy instead of defaulting missing booleans/numbers.
- Final `BET` payloads now carry the exact option `raw_symbol`, a live entry quote snapshot, quote freshness, quote-valid-until, and an explicit execution policy block. Runtime liquidation tracks that exact contract via `options:live:contract_state:{raw_symbol}` / `options:live:tradability:{raw_symbol}` instead of comparing against unrelated same-symbol option trades.
- Completed-window and candidate quote lookups append `source=sigmatiq_nexus_contract_reference` persistence events for the exact `options:live:contract_state:{raw_symbol}` / `options:live:tradability:{raw_symbol}` keys Nexus used. The persistence worker stores only those referenced contracts, not the full raw option universe.
- Single-leg final `BET` publishing fails closed when the exact contract has no fresh executable quote; the fresh quote reference becomes the recorded entry price.
- Single-leg active positions are persisted to Redis and restored on worker startup for the current NY session.
- Spread `BET` payloads are paper-only, publish to `nexus_spread_overlay:{symbol}:{strategy}:{entry_label}`, and are not attached to the current single-leg liquidation loop.


## Enriched Option Market Context

Nexus publishes a market-context feed separate from strategy signals. Strategy decisions remain limited to researched morning windows, but option market context continues across the full session.

- Completed-window key: `nexus_option_market_context:{symbol}:{window_id}`
- Latest key: `nexus_option_market_context:{symbol}:latest`
- Pub/Sub: `signal:option_market_context`
- Windows: every 30 minutes from `09:30-16:00` ET plus optional `16:00-16:15`
- Purpose: provide premiums, heavily traded contracts, cheap/costly contracts, cheap/costly side, liquidity quality, pricing quality, and late-event impact to API/UI consumers
- Boundary: this feed is not a strategy signal and does not use `WINDOW_VIEW` sentiment

## Runtime configuration

- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection URL used by the worker.
- `NEXUS_REDIS_CLUSTER`: set to `true` for Azure clustered Redis. In cluster mode Nexus reads each configured input stream separately so Redis does not reject multi-key `XREAD` calls across hash slots.
- `NEXUS_INPUT_STREAM`: optional explicit Redis stream. If absent, Nexus consumes `md:{symbol}:options:trades`.
- `NEXUS_STREAM_START_ID`: initial Redis Stream ID when no stored offset exists, default `0-0`.
- `NEXUS_STREAM_OFFSET_KEY`: Redis key template for saved stream offsets, default `nexus:stream_offset:{stream}`.
- `NEXUS_SYMBOLS`: comma-separated symbols to process, default `SPY,QQQ,IWM,UVXY`.
- `NEXUS_HEALTH_SYMBOLS`: comma-separated symbols that must appear in Nexus health, default `SPY,QQQ,IWM,UVXY`.
- `NEXUS_HEALTH_KEY`: Redis key for the Nexus health payload, default `health:nexus`.
- `NEXUS_GROUP_LOCK_STRATEGIES`: comma-separated strategy names that should also share one cross-symbol group lock, default `etf_confluence_sniper`.
- `NEXUS_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS`: Redis first-trigger lock TTL, default `28800`.
- `NEXUS_ACTIVE_POSITION_TTL_SECONDS`: Redis active-position state TTL, default `28800`.
- `NEXUS_WINDOW_EVALUATION_GRACE_SECONDS`: delay after a decision boundary before evaluating the completed window, default `15`.
- `NEXUS_IV_SURFACE_KEY`, `NEXUS_VRP_KEY`, `NEXUS_GEX_KEY`: canonical live options-worker context key templates, defaulting to `options:live:*:{symbol}` keys. Nexus does not use legacy scalar fallback keys for strategy readiness.
- `NEXUS_EQUITY_CONTEXT_KEY`: equity live context key template, default `equity:live:context:{symbol}`.
- `NEXUS_CONTRACT_TRADABILITY_KEY`: option tradability key template, default `options:live:tradability:{raw_symbol}`.
- `NEXUS_CONTRACT_STATE_KEY`: per-contract quote plus Greek state key template, default `options:live:contract_state:{raw_symbol}`.
- `NEXUS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT_TIMESTAMPS`: default `true`; timestamp-less scalar context keys are blocked for live strategy decisions.
- `NEXUS_VOL_CONTEXT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`: max IV/VRP context age, default `120`.
- `NEXUS_GEX_CONTEXT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`: max GEX context age, default `120`.
- `NEXUS_UNDERLYING_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`: max underlying state age on enriched events, default `5`.
- `NEXUS_OPTION_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`: max option quote/mid age on enriched events, default `5`.
- `NEXUS_GREEK_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`: max Greek age on enriched events, default `60`.
- `NEXUS_SWEEP_PREMIUM_USD`: quote-derived sweep threshold when raw `is_sweep` is absent, default `25000`.
- `NEXUS_EXECUTION_MAX_SLIPPAGE_PCT`: slippage ceiling published in `BET` and `LIQUIDATE` execution blocks, default `5.0`.
- `NEXUS_SPREAD_STRIKE_WIDTH`: vertical spread width, default `5.0`.
- `NEXUS_SPREAD_TARGET_DELTA`: target absolute short-leg delta for spread candidate selection, default `0.15`.
- `NEXUS_SPREAD_MIN_ENTRY_CREDIT`: minimum net credit required before a spread `BET` is published, default `0.30`.
- `NEXUS_SPREAD_MAX_IV_RANK`: maximum IV rank allowed for spread open30 candidates, default `30.0`.
- `NEXUS_SPREAD_TAKE_PROFIT_PCT`, `NEXUS_SPREAD_STOP_LOSS_PCT`, `NEXUS_SPREAD_HOLD_SECONDS`: paper spread risk metadata, defaults `20.0`, `75.0`, and `1800`.
- `NEXUS_MIN_WINDOW_PREMIUM` and `NEXUS_SIDE_DOMINANCE`: window-level premium and side-dominance thresholds.
- `NEXUS_OPEN_CALL_DOMINANCE`: opening cheap-call dominance threshold, default `1.5`.
- `LIVE_PERSISTENCE_EVENT_STREAM`: Redis Stream for durable signal capture, default `live:persistence:events`.

## Health contract

Nexus publishes a sidecar health payload to `health:nexus`. The payload is fail-closed operational evidence for the four-symbol pilot universe and includes:

- `expectedSymbols`, `activeSymbols`, and `missingSymbols`.
- Per-symbol input stream name, offset key, last consumed offset, last input timestamp, event timestamp, and consumed count.
- Per-symbol output families and publish counts for `window_view`, `window_pricing`, `window_late_event`, `intermediate`, `live_overlay`, `spread_overlay`, `final_block`, `option_market_context`, and `participant_flow_context`.
- Per-symbol blocked-message counts and counts by reason, including final-block and live-feature-quality gate reasons.
- `lastError`, `lastErrorUtc`, and `degradedReasons`.

This key is intended for sigmatiq-api and pipeline monitoring. Nexus still writes the canonical payload keys and appends to `live:persistence:events`; the health key does not replace those contracts.

Operationally, a valid no-trade day means the symbol has fresh input activity and Nexus output families such as `window_view`, `window_pricing`, `option_market_context`, or `participant_flow_context` are advancing, while `final_block` or `BLOCKED` counts explain any fail-closed decisions. An unhealthy pipeline has missing symbol activity, stale or absent offsets, no advancing output families, or a populated `lastError`.

## Feature audit

Before enabling a live strategy, verify the Redis payload shape:

```bash
nexus-audit-features --symbol SPY --limit 5
```

The audit reports which implemented strategies are `ready`, `degraded`, or `blocked` based on the sampled trade event plus live IV/GEX context. It also reports `stale` or `unknown_freshness` when a required field exists but cannot be trusted at decision time. The full feature contract is documented in `docs/NEXUS_LIVE_FEATURE_CONTRACT.md`.

At runtime Nexus enriches raw option trade events from:

- `equity:live:context:{symbol}` for `underlying_mid` and spot freshness.
- `options:live:tradability:{raw_symbol}` for option bid/ask/mid, quote timestamp, spread, and executable/tradability flags.
- `options:live:contract_state:{raw_symbol}` for option mid, quote quality, tradability flags, underlying spot, and Greeks.
- If raw trades omit `aggressor` or `is_sweep`, Nexus derives them only from fresh quote state; stale or untradable quotes still block the relevant strategy.

## Operational logging

Nexus now emits structured JSON logs for the decision path so production checks can separate input, gating, and signal failures quickly.

- `worker_started`, `redis_connected`, `stream_batch_received`: confirms the worker is alive and reading Redis streams.
- `slot_candidate_received`, `window_evaluation_started`: confirms events are arriving for a symbol and a completed NY window is being evaluated with real premium totals.
- `stream_offsets_restored`: confirms Redis Stream restart offsets were loaded.
- `window_due_for_evaluation`: confirms a completed window passed the configured grace period and is being evaluated.
- `window_late_event_detected`: confirms a delayed trade landed after its window was already evaluated and was recorded as audit-only impact.
- `strategy_blocked`: emitted when fail-closed feature gates reject a strategy due to missing or stale live fields.
- `strategy_window_view_published`: emitted when a strategy publishes its directional read of a completed window as `BULLISH`, `BEARISH`, or `CHOP`.
- `window_pricing_published`: emitted when Nexus publishes the separate cheap-versus-costly contract summary for the completed strategy window.
- `option_market_context_published`: emitted when Nexus publishes full-session enriched option market context for a completed market-context window.
- `strategy_no_signal`: emitted when data is present but the heuristic or model threshold did not qualify.
- `strategy_intermediate_published`, `strategy_final_published`, `strategy_spread_final_published`, `position_liquidated`: emitted when Nexus actually produces a signal or exits a live position.

Example grep targets:

```bash
rg '"event":"window_evaluation_started"|\"event\":\"strategy_no_signal\"|\"event\":\"strategy_final_published\"'
```

## Tech Stack
- **Polars:** Vectorized trade processing.
- **ONNX Runtime:** Native execution of TCN and RL models.
- **Redis Streams:** Persistent, high-throughput message bus.

## Extension
To add a new strategy:
1. Define a new logic class in `src/sigmatiq_nexus/strategies/`.
2. Add the corresponding `.onnx` model to the `models/` folder.
3. Register the strategy in the main `worker.py` loop.
